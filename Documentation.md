## Literals
| Type            | Syntax    | Example   |
|----             |----       |----       |
| Integers        | `NUM`     | `10`      |
| Floats/Decimals | `NUM,NUM` |`10,5`     |
| Strings/Text    | `"TEXT"`  | `"Hello"` |

Integers are treated as Floats for simplicity.

## Phrases
Intuitive provides a set of basic instructions called phrases.
All phrases end with a `.`, like a normal phrase would.
Programs are composed of phrases,

## Synonims
They are what makes Intuitive special.
Almost all instructions can be written in many ways, exactly the same as a real language.

Each instruction has concise and verbose forms. 
The most idiomatic ones are listed below, but you can mix the core statements with any Linker, allowing for rich expressions.

## Linkers
Linkers are connectors that you can mix in between of phrases to increase readibility or make them more intuitive for newcomers.

Linkers are effectively ignored by the compiler, so they can be used anywhere.




## Variables
All variables must start with an UPPERCASE letter. 
This is to avoid having too much keywords, as every synonim would be a reserved keyword.
